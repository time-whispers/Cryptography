# Python Cryptography

The study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to read its contents is known as cryptography. The word comes from the Greek word "kryptos," which meaning "hidden."

It's closely linked to encryption, which is the process of scrambling plain text into ciphertext and then back again when it's received. In addition, cryptography includes techniques such as microdots and merging to obfuscate information in photographs. 

This is a little cryptography tool that I created. It doesn't accomplish much, but it will get the job done. 

## Instructions for Use:

- Clone the repository or download the contents of the repository as a Zip file.
- Set up Python on your computer
- Run the cryptography.py file by running <i>cryptography.py</i> or <i>cryptography</i> on it.
- The user is then requested to enter his or her message, after which he or she is prompted to either encode or decode it.
- If you're the sender, type 'e or E' to encrypt the message, then copy and send the encoded text to the receiver. 
- Type 'd or D' to decode the message and read the original message if you're a receiver.
